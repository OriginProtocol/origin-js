# origin-js

origin-js is a library of javascript code and Ethereum smart contracts which allow anyone to create decentralized marketplaces, including for fractional usage. It is an open source project created by [Origin Protocol](https://www.originprotocol.com/).

⚠️ This is an alpha version which is not suitable for production environments.

## Documentation
[origin-js documentation](http://docs.originprotocol.com/)

## Demo

origin-js is showcased in our Demo DApp currently running on the Rinkeby testnet. 
- [Overview and step-by-step instructions](https://medium.com/originprotocol/origin-demo-dapp-is-now-live-on-testnet-835ae201c58)
- [Live Demo](http://demo.originprotocol.com)
- [Github Repo](https://github.com/OriginProtocol/demo-dapp)

## Using origin-js in your project

### As a node package

```
npm install origin --save
```
or
```
yarn add origin
```

### Plain javascript

A browser-compatible plain javascript file `origin.js` is available in the [Releases section](https://github.com/OriginProtocol/origin-js/releases). A hosted version can be directly included in your html as:
```html
<script src="https://code.originprotocol.com/origin-js/origin-v0.6.1.js"></script>
```

`npm build` will generate this file and save it to `dist/origin.js`.

## Local development

### 1. Clone this repo.
```
git clone https://github.com/OriginProtocol/origin-js.git && cd origin-js
```

If you would like to submit pull requests, you should instead fork this repo and then clone your fork. Note pull requests should always be made to the `develop` branch, which always has the latest commits.

### 2. Install dependencies and link
```
npm run install:dev
```

`install:dev` is shortcut for `npm install && npm link`. Linking means that changes to `origin-js` code are immediately available to local DApps without an `npm install`. 

### 3. Start the local blockchain and build origin-js

```
npm start
```

Code changes will trigger a live rebuild.
    
### 4. Use with local Demo DApp

To interact with your local origin-js and local blockahin, see [the instructions in our Demo DApp](https://github.com/OriginProtocol/demo-dapp#developing-with-a-local-chain).


## Tests

### Command Line (All Tests)

Our full test suite can be run with:

```
npm run test
```

 Note: you should *not* have the server running at this time, as these tests start their own local blockchain instance.

 ### Command Line (Only Solidity Tests)

Our Solidity tests (which use [Truffle](http://truffleframework.com/docs/getting_started/javascript-tests)) are located at `contracts/test`.

 ```
 npm run test:contracts
 ```

Note: you should *not* have the server running at this time, as these tests start their own local blockchain instance.

### Browser Tests

A subset of our tests can be run from the browser. These tests are automatically served at `http://localhost:8081` when you run `npm start`. These tests are automatically rerun when source or test code is changed.

Run a subset of these tests using the `grep` query string parameter, for example: http://localhost:8081/?grep=IpfsService

## Troubleshooting

### Python 3

If you have Python 3 installed, you may see this error when installing dependencies:

```
gyp ERR! stack Error: Python executable "/Users/aiham/.pyenv/shims/python" is v3.6.4, which is not supported by gyp.
```

Resolve this by configuring npm to use Python 2 (where python2.7 is a binary accessible from your $PATH):

```
npm config set python python2.7
```
