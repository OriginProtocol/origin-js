This file is the template for generating an issue for each release.

---

NOTE: This checklist is generated from [RELEASE.md](https://github.com/OriginProtocol/origin-js/blob/master/RELEASE.md) when beginning the release procedure.

## Prepare a release candidate
Release branches should be created well before a release is ready to be published. Sometime after a prior release has been merged and once all of a release's planned features have been merged to `master`, a new branch should be created from `master`:
- [ ] _origin-dapp_: Create a release branch (if applicable)
  - `git checkout -b release-0.8.0 master`
- [ ] _origin-js_: Create a release branch (if applicable)
  - `git checkout -b release-0.8.0 master`
- [ ] _origin-bridge_: Create a release branch (if applicable)
  - `git checkout -b release-0.8.0 master`

No additional features should be added to this release branch. Only bug fixes should be merged directly to the release branch, which itself should eventually be merged back to `master` in the [Publish](#publish) step.

## Confirm readiness
- [ ] _origin-js_ : In `package.json`, confirm version is `0.8.0`
- [ ] _origin-js_: Confirm js tests passing
  - `docker-compose -f docker-compose-test.yml up origin-js-test`
- [ ] _origin-dapp_: Confirm it runs against local (linked) origin-js
  - `docker-compose up`
  - `open http://localhost:3000/`
  - Note: Probably need to **Reset Account** on MetaMask.
- [ ] Build DApp in production mode locally
  - `npm run build`
  - This will generate build directory.
  - `cd build && python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000`
- [ ] Confirm deployment accounts have eth for gas.
  - Both accounts [0] and [1] need gas, as test listings are created from [1].
  - Set mnemonic
    - `export RINKEBY_MNEMONIC="_____"`
    - `export ROPSTEN_MNEMONIC=$RINKEBY_MNEMONIC`
  - `npm run scripts/deploy_checklist.js`
  - [ ] Rinkeby ([Faucet](https://faucet.rinkeby.io/))

## Publish
### origin-js
- [ ] _origin-js_ : In `package.json`, confirm version is `0.8.0`
- [ ] _origin_js Update README.md example code to new version.
  - `<script src="https://code.originprotocol.com/origin-js/origin-v0.8.0.js"></script>`
- [ ] If contracts have changed:
  - Show diff with: `git diff stable..master contracts/contracts/`
  - `cd contracts`
  - [ ] Deploy new smart contracts to Ropsten. Be sure addresses are listed in ABI files.
    - `npx truffle migrate --reset --network ropsten | tee releases/0.8.0_ropsten.log`
  - [ ] Deploy new smart contracts to Rinkeby.  Be sure addresses are listed in ABI files.
    - `npx truffle migrate --reset --network rinkeby | tee releases/0.8.0_rinkeby.log`
  - [ ] Migrate data from old contracts to new. (Once we get around to writing migrations!)
  - [ ] _origin-js_: Build `origin.js` file (in `dist/origin.js`) using `npm run build` -- **Not redundant:** This will bake in the new contract addresses into `./node_modules/origin/dist/origin.js`
  (Note: I think we can actually do this after `npm publish`, as that does an inplicity `npm run build` as part of publishing... But then, we need to be able to test...)
    - `npm run install:dev`
- [ ] _origin-js_: Merge and push branches
  - `git checkout master`
  - `git merge --no-ff rerelease-0.8.0`
  - `git push`
  - `git checkout stable`
  - `git merge --no-ff rerelease-0.8.0`
  - `git push`
- [ ] _origin-js_: Delete release branch
  - `git branch -D rerelease-0.8.0`
  - _Manually_ [delete on GitHub](https://github.com/OriginProtocol/origin-js/branches)
- [ ] _origin-js_: Create new [GitHub release](https://github.com/OriginProtocol/origin-js/releases) with origin.js code,
  - [ ] Version in form `v0.8.0` (This will add git tag on `stable`)
  - [ ] Include output of Truffle logs (containing addresses of smart contracts) in description
  - [ ] Include block number the contracts were deployed at
    - `https://rinkeby.etherscan.io/address/<contract address>`
    - ex. `https://rinkeby.etherscan.io/address/0x29d260c47411a0b9eeeb087925afa759914b0d2f`
- [ ] _origin-js_: [Publish to npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/publish).
  - `npm publish`

### origin-dapp
- [ ] _origin-dapp_: Build against npm version. This will update `package-lock.json`
  - `npm unlink --no-save origin && npm install && npm run build`
- [ ] `git add package.json && git commit -m "0.8.0 release"`
- [ ] _origin-dapp_: Merge and push branches
  - `git checkout master`
  - `git merge --no-ff release-0.8.0`
  - `git push`
  - `git checkout stable`
  - `git merge --no-ff release-0.8.0`
  - `git push`
- [ ] _origin-js_: Delete release branch
  - `git branch -D release-0.8.0`
  - _Manually_ [delete on GitHub](https://github.com/OriginProtocol/origin-dapp/branches)
- [ ] _origin-dapp_: Confirm that origin-dapp works when run alone again NPM.
- [ ] _origin-dapp_: Test deploy dapp to heroku
  - `git clone https://github.com/OriginProtocol/origin-dapp/tree/stable && cd origin-dapp`
  - `heroku create && git push heroku master`
- [ ] _origin-dapp_: Add git tag to `stable` to match origin-js.
  - `git tag -a v0.8.0 -m "New release"`
- Create IFPFS deploy of DApp
  - `scripts/deploy.sh` (See usage notes in file)

### origin-bridge
Prerequesites:
 - Install the [Heroku cli](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-cli) on your local host.

Publish steps:
- [ ] Merge and push branches.
  - `git checkout master`
  - `git merge --no-ff release-X.Y.Z`
  - `git push`
  - `git checkout stable`
  - `git merge --no-ff release-X.Y.Z`
  - `git push`
- [ ] Delete release branch.
  - `git branch -D release-X.Y.Z`
  - _Manually_ [delete on GitHub](https://github.com/OriginProtocol/origin-bridge/branches)
- [ ] Add git tag to `stable` to match origin-js.
  - `git checkout stable`
  - `git tag -a vX.Y.Z -m "New release"`
  - `git push`
- [ ] Push to Heroku.
  - Clone Heroku git repo.
    - `heroku git:clone -a bridge-originprotocol-com`
    - `cd bridge-originprotocol-com/`
  - Pull Origin's `stable` into Heroku's `master`.
    - `git remote add origin https://github.com/OriginProtocol/origin-bridge.git`
    - `git pull origin stable`
  - Push to heroku's git repo. This will also trigger Heroku to rebuild the packages, run DB migration(s) and deploy the new code.
    - `git push heroku master`
- [ ] Check the Heroku deployment succeeded.
  - Check the web process is up.
    - `heroku ps -a bridge-originprotocol-com`
  - Tail the logs for errors.
    - `heroku logs -a bridge-originprotocol-com --tail`
  - Verify the [home page](https://bridge.originprotocol.com) loads.

## Follow-up
- [ ] Confirm published `origin.js` file is accessible via `code.originprotocol.com` redirect
  - https://code.originprotocol.com/origin-js/origin-v0.8.0.js
- [ ] _origin-dapp_ `npm unlink --no-save origin`
- [ ] _origin-dapp_: Confirm that "one-line setup & run" command works on `stable` branch shown by default
- [ ] _origin-js_: Increment version number on `master` to for next release
  - `git checkout master`
  - `subl package.json`
- [ ] `git push`
- [ ] _docs_: Review docs for needed updates. Confirm example code on playground site (jsfiddle?) still work.
- [ ] Copy this to-do list into new issue for next sprint.
- [ ] Post notice of new release on Discord

## Troubleshooting

- `Error: insufficient funds for gas * price + value`:
  - Not enough funds in primary or secondary account. Usually hits when I forget to put funds in second account and it trys to deploy sample listings.
- Environment variables not being found despite adding them to the Heroku config:
  - Confirm that they are included in the [Webpack config](https://github.com/OriginProtocol/origin-dapp/blob/stable/webpack.config.js#L12-L20).
