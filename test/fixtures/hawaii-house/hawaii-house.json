You enter the property through a grove of citrus and macadamia trees. A floating walkway takes you across a koi pond, surrounded by lush greenery and a waterfall. Once inside, the 5,391-square-foot home is comprised of a master and two guest suites, each with a private staircase leading down to the garden courtyard. A chef's kitchen with koa cabinetry looks onto a double-height living area. Flanked by sliding doors, the room opens to a veranda that overlooks two swimming pools and the Kona coastline. Consisting of 90 acres, the grounds also feature a driving range, tennis court, bocce courts, and a three-car garage.","location":"Kailua, Hawaii, US","pictures":[],"price":8.5},"signed_by":"https://keybase.io/joshfraser","signature":"-----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE-----\n  Version: Keybase OpenPGP v2.0.73\n  Comment: https://keybase.io/crypto\n\n  wsBcBAABCgAGBQJZlhmAAAoJEKTjGE37cmbxy38IALSQxXAE4wVc8d4rP0v8TaBE\n  MolxVoyev2MXUz0wdclXS2mmKMSVObiFOqjrCxqBTvzQRYbquuSQUTzO4t/C1WPp\n  AEodUf7KSBH7fGnuYVixIRvrvtF2MMGlFm/U1MpY1CtY5G+UYhzdoLWvOGf5b1yw\n  BiTAwczR7KqtFOYYdmNuIIqsUvLlV6fQjCihItIgc2521iZYxNUBSBjhINEtCUvV\n  L6tE1lR1dMcKOa7JMTqQsbGloiD5t2IsEdzxbzgWlheTjcqoN6id+QzPC1DK9mjX\n  b7Qf9nchgZZhJdOBSoSRqf47nxdUx1bqY1DIR+hOyF+p6j2nYVMcDD5Z3uB/tns=\n  =A9r6\n  -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----"}
