  "title": "MAMALAHOA ESTATE",
  "description": "Built on the slopes of Hualalai Mountain in Kailua, Hawaii, the Mamalahoa Estate knows how to make a first impression. You enter the property through a grove of citrus and macadamia trees. A floating walkway takes you across a koi pond, surrounded by lush greenery and a waterfall. Once inside, the 5,391-square-foot home is comprised of a master and two guest suites, each with a private staircase leading down to the garden courtyard. A chef's kitchen with koa cabinetry looks onto a double-height living area. Flanked by sliding doors, the room opens to a veranda that overlooks two swimming pools and the Kona coastline. Consisting of 90 acres, the grounds also feature a driving range, tennis court, bocce courts, and a three-car garage.",
