{"schema":"http://localhost:3000/schemas/housing.json","data":{"name":"Casa Wolf","category":"Vacation Rentals","description":"Overlooking Lake Llanquihue, Casa Wulf is inspired by the terrain. The home sits on a steep slope. This lead to its three-story design, creating a natural balcony facing the water. Among the levels, the main living area is at the center, with the bedrooms above and a basement workshop below. Each floor was constructed using a different system, resulting in a range of facades. Their orientation takes advantage of the incoming sunlight and while also exposing the interiors to the surrounding landscape.","location":"-41.010387, -72.763702","pictures":[],"price":1.5},"signed_by":"https://keybase.io/joshfraser","signature":"-----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE-----\n  Version: Keybase OpenPGP v2.0.73\n  Comment: https://keybase.io/crypto\n\n  wsBcBAABCgAGBQJZlhmAAAoJEKTjGE37cmbxy38IALSQxXAE4wVc8d4rP0v8TaBE\n  MolxVoyev2MXUz0wdclXS2mmKMSVObiFOqjrCxqBTvzQRYbquuSQUTzO4t/C1WPp\n  AEodUf7KSBH7fGnuYVixIRvrvtF2MMGlFm/U1MpY1CtY5G+UYhzdoLWvOGf5b1yw\n  BiTAwczR7KqtFOYYdmNuIIqsUvLlV6fQjCihItIgc2521iZYxNUBSBjhINEtCUvV\n  L6tE1lR1dMcKOa7JMTqQsbGloiD5t2IsEdzxbzgWlheTjcqoN6id+QzPC1DK9mjX\n  b7Qf9nchgZZhJdOBSoSRqf47nxdUx1bqY1DIR+hOyF+p6j2nYVMcDD5Z3uB/tns=\n  =A9r6\n  -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----"}
