{"schema":"http://localhost:3000/schemas/housing.json","data":{"name":"Zinc House","category":"Vacation Rentals","description":"Due to multiple limitations, the Zinc House goes against tradition to capture the best views of the sea. The contemporary structure is comprised of four interlocking volumes. A white wing houses the garage, leading to a two-story zinc entrance hall. From here, the home flips the conventional layout, putting bedrooms on the ground floor and the main living area above in a timber-clad box. Flanked by glazed panels, the kitchen and living room can overlook the garden in the rear and the coast ahead.","location":"-8.640509, 179.073778","pictures":[],"price":3.999},"signed_by":"https://keybase.io/joshfraser","signature":"-----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE-----\n  Version: Keybase OpenPGP v2.0.73\n  Comment: https://keybase.io/crypto\n\n  wsBcBAABCgAGBQJZlhmAAAoJEKTjGE37cmbxy38IALSQxXAE4wVc8d4rP0v8TaBE\n  MolxVoyev2MXUz0wdclXS2mmKMSVObiFOqjrCxqBTvzQRYbquuSQUTzO4t/C1WPp\n  AEodUf7KSBH7fGnuYVixIRvrvtF2MMGlFm/U1MpY1CtY5G+UYhzdoLWvOGf5b1yw\n  BiTAwczR7KqtFOYYdmNuIIqsUvLlV6fQjCihItIgc2521iZYxNUBSBjhINEtCUvV\n  L6tE1lR1dMcKOa7JMTqQsbGloiD5t2IsEdzxbzgWlheTjcqoN6id+QzPC1DK9mjX\n  b7Qf9nchgZZhJdOBSoSRqf47nxdUx1bqY1DIR+hOyF+p6j2nYVMcDD5Z3uB/tns=\n  =A9r6\n  -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----"}
